Happiness and fun
Be humble. Put the focus on them, not you.
Take breaks
During the breaks encourage everyone to close their laptops, walk around, chat, and have some snacks.
Ask about previous experiences
Lie to simplify. Focus on the most important knowledge
Break things down into small, digestible steps
Use metaphors: Different people tend to soak up new concepts in different ways.
Also consider trying more creative learning methods.
Try to be flexible and adjust to the group, and every student individually.
Experiment with, and mix different styles of teaching, like
    Do lecture-style classes where you explain and demonstrate concepts on a shared screen or projector
    Let students pair up, and solve small exercises
    Let the entire group work conduct a role playing game, or brainstorm ideas for a story or comic about a small piece of code
    Let them brainstorm and discuss ideas for things that could be represented as, e.g. hashes, nested arrays, objects
    Let students research a certain, small topic during the week and then present about it during your group meeting
Even though impossible, try to make zero assumptions.
Give your group long term perspectives.
Come up with a curriculum
Educate yourself
